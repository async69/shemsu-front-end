## Getting Started

These instructions will get you start this project locally.

### Prerequisites

First you have to have Node, npm or yarn installed on your computer.

### Installing

In this application I have package.json. One for the nodejs server, the other one for the client. Client was created using "create-react-app"; But either in these folders, you can install packages in the same way as follows:



```
yarn install
```


This will start the webpack dev server which will serve the client UI.
